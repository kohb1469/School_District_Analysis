# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze school district data and create different types of data frames to display a district summary, school summary, top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, average math/reading/combined scores and creating seperate data frames that seperate scores based on school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.

After creating these dataframes, I simulated that the 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School were flagged for academic dishonesty and therefore the grades for that entire grade was voided. I cleaned through the same data, and performed similar analysis on the new cleaned data.

## Results

* District Summary - District Summary was barely affected, the percentages of passing for math, reading and overall score was only lowered by less than a percent.
* School Summary - For School summary, since the data was split by schools, only Thomas High School was affected, and their overall scores significantly dropped from 90% to about 65%. The rest of the schools remain unaffected
* Thomas High School went from being one of the top schools in percentage of tests pass to becoming one of the top schools to getting kicked out into the bottom few. However, when the 9th graders scores are factored out of the equation, Thomas High School remains one of the top 5 schools.

* For the dataframes filterd by grade, school spending, school size and school type, once the 9th grade scores were filtered out, the data largely remained the same, some scores differ by about a percentage.
